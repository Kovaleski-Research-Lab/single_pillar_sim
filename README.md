# single_pillar_sim

This experiment lets us characterize a single meta-atom pillar under local phase approximation. We are repeating the experiment conducted in [this journal paper](![raeker](/References/RAEKER_2021.pdf)), Fig. 3.

The experiment simulates a high-index meta-atom pillar on top of a glass (fused silica) substrate embedded in PDMS, a flexible plastic material. The 3D simulation is run `experiment.num` number of times, with the pillar radius increasing from 75 nm to 250 nm with each iteration.

At the end of each simulation, transmission and phase information are recorded by means of a flux monitor.
